# Gsap-slider-animation

so i want someboy to help me make a responsive slider and it follows like this:
1. The background Text will fade up
2. The shoe will translate off of the screen
3. the next background text will fade in from Y-axis
4. the next shoe will translate x-axis opposite off the last shoe
5. You can go ahead and make it more fun!!!!
